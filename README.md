GitTunes
========

 A simple application that will give you the ability to track and attach the music you've been listening to while creating awesome software!

What Does It Do?
----------------

 Well right now, it will just display currently playing information if you're using Spotify or iTunes. I'm going to try to expand this to as many native music playing applications that I can find. If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

What Will It Do?
----------------

 Here are a short list of things that I want to accomplish for this little program.

 1. Define a format to track the songs on a given working session. (Encode album art?)
 2. Add ability to attach songs to HEAD or specific commit.
 3. Automatically figure out when you're 'working' so you don't have to click a button.
 4. Possibly work with GitHub to get this info displaying
 5. Visualize the data!

Special Thanks
--------------
I'd like to thank [Andrew Wooster](https://github.com/wooster) for inspiring me with his [git-gps project](https://github.com/wooster/git-gps), as well as for borrowing his GGGitTool class!

General Info
------------

 As usual please feel free to contact me for features or questions, maybe even some help! Thanks!
